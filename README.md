# Chess.com-Club-Stats
Script to gather rating information for members of a Chess Club in chess.com

Change CLUB_NAME to the name of your club in chess.com before running the script.
Information is stored in an Excel Spreadsheet called Club_Data.xlsx in the current directory.
A chart with the ratings of each club member for every rating type is also generated
although it's not readable if there are many members in the club.
You can disable the chart by changing PLOT to False.
